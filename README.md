## Assignment Overview
This repository contains our submission for Assignment 2 of Formal Languages. The assignment is based on the context-free grammar:

```
S -> aSb | ε
```

We have implemented three distinct algorithms:

### Algorithm 1:
- **Purpose**: Generate strings that belong to the language (accepted) and strings that do not belong (rejected) but use the same alphabet `{a, b}`.
- **Details**:
  - Accepted strings follow the pattern `(a^n b^n)` (e.g., "", "ab", "aabb", "aaabbb").
  - Rejected strings are examples that do not meet this pattern.
- **File**: `ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JMLC.py`

### Algorithm 2:
- **Purpose**: Implement a Pushdown Automaton (PDA) that recognizes strings generated by the grammar `G`.
- **Details**:
  - The PDA pushes a marker for every 'a' and pops for every 'b'.
  - The algorithm processes the input symbol by symbol and logs a detailed history of configurations (position, current symbol, and stack contents).
  - This history is useful for debugging and for constructing derivation trees later.

### Algorithm 3:
- **Purpose**: Build a leftmost derivation tree (or list of sentential forms) for accepted strings by the grammar `G`.
- **Details**:
  - For any accepted string of the form `(a^n b^n)`, the derivation is constructed starting from the start symbol `(S)` and repeatedly applying the production `(S → a S b)` until `(S)` is replaced by `(ε)`.
  - The output is printed with increasing indentation to clearly display the derivation process.

## How to Run
### Step 1: Generate Strings
```bash
python ALGORITHM_1_LFCO_2025_JMLC.py
```

### Step 2: Execute the PDA
```bash
python ALGORITHM_2_LFCO_2025_JMLC.py
```

### Step 3: Build the Derivation Tree
```bash
python ALGORITHM_3_LFCO_2025_JMLC.py
```
